        Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID,
        and scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target
        identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy
        until you have registered the resource as a scalable target.

        Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same
        scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling
        policies, one or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is
        a chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the scalable
        target to scale out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling
        gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity for
        both scale out and scale in. For example, if one policy increases
        capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and the
        current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with
        the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30.

        We recommend caution, however, when using target tracking scaling
        policies with step scaling policies because conflicts between these
        policies can cause undesirable behavior. For example, if the step
        scaling policy initiates a scale-in activity before the target tracking
        policy is ready to scale in, the scale-in activity will not be blocked.
        After the scale-in activity completes, the target tracking policy could
        instruct the scalable target to scale out again.

        A scalable target is a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale
        out and scale in. Scalable targets are uniquely identified by the
        combination of resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace.

        When you register a new scalable target, you must specify values for
        minimum and maximum capacity. Current capacity will be adjusted within
        the specified range when scaling starts. Application Auto Scaling
        scaling policies will not scale capacity to values that are outside of
        this range.

        After you register a scalable target, you do not need to register it
        again to use other Application Auto Scaling operations. To see which
        resources have been registered, use
        `DescribeScalableTargets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DescribeScalableTargets.html>`__.

        If you no longer need a scalable target, you can deregister it by using
        `DeregisterScalableTarget <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DeregisterScalableTarget.html>`__.

        resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace. Any parameters that you
        don't specify are not changed by this update request.

        If you call the ``RegisterScalableTarget`` API to update an existing
        scalable target, Application Auto Scaling retrieves the current capacity
        of the resource. If it is below the minimum capacity or above the
        maximum capacity, Application Auto Scaling adjusts the capacity of the
