        Amazon Web Services account with the specified creation token, this
        operation does the following:

        -  Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon
           EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state ``creating``.

        -  Returns with the description of the created file system.

        Otherwise, this operation returns a ``FileSystemAlreadyExists`` error
        with the ID of the existing file system.

        For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the
        creation token.

        The idempotent operation allows you to retry a ``CreateFileSystem`` call
        without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an
        initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a
        file system was actually created. An example might be that a transport
        level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use
        the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a
        file system, the client can learn of its existence from the
        ``FileSystemAlreadyExists`` error.

        This operation accepts an optional ``PerformanceMode`` parameter that
        you choose for your file system. We recommend ``generalPurpose``
        performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the ``maxIO``
        performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and
        operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for
        most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the
        file system has been created. For more information, see `Amazon EFS
        performance
        modes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html>`__.

        You can set the throughput mode for the file system using the
        ``ThroughputMode`` parameter.

        After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle

        You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC.
        All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a
        single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple
        subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the
        subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount
        target in order to access their file system.

        You can create only one mount target for an EFS file system using One
        Zone storage classes. You must create that mount target in the same
        Availability Zone in which the file system is located. Use the
        ``AvailabilityZoneName`` and ``AvailabiltyZoneId`` properties in the
        DescribeFileSystems response object to get this information. Use the
        ``subnetId`` associated with the file system's Availability Zone when
        creating the mount target.

        For more information, see `Amazon EFS: How it
        Works <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html>`__.

        To create a mount target for a file system, the file system's lifecycle
        state must be ``available``. For more information, see
        DescribeFileSystems.

        In the request, provide the following:

        -  The file system ID for which you are creating the mount target.

        -  A subnet ID, which determines the following:

           -  The VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target

           -  The Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target

           -  The IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address
              of the mount target (if you don't specify an IP address in the
              request)

        After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that
        includes, a ``MountTargetId`` and an ``IpAddress``. You use this IP
        address when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also
        use the mount target's DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2
        instance on which you mount the file system by using the mount target
        can resolve the mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more
        information, see `How it Works: Implementation
        Overview <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation>`__.

        Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one
        VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That
        is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets created for
        it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must
        meet the following requirements:

        -  Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount
           targets

        -  Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of
           the existing mount targets

        If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the
        following:

        -  Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.

        -  Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:

           -  If the request provides an ``IpAddress``, Amazon EFS assigns that
              IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns
              a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2
              ``CreateNetworkInterface`` call does when a request does not
              specify a primary private IP address).

           -  If the request provides ``SecurityGroups``, this network interface
              is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to
              the default security group for the subnet's VPC.

           -  Assigns the description
              ``Mount target fsmt-id for file system fs-id`` where ``fsmt-id``
              is the mount target ID, and ``fs-id`` is the ``FileSystemId``.

           -  Sets the ``requesterManaged`` property of the network interface to
              ``true``, and the ``requesterId`` value to ``EFS``.

           Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requester-managed
           EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon
           EFS sets the ``NetworkInterfaceId`` field in the mount target's
           description to the network interface ID, and the ``IpAddress`` field
           to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire
           ``CreateMountTarget`` operation fails.

        The ``CreateMountTarget`` call returns only after creating the network
        interface, but while the mount target state is still ``creating``, you
        can check the mount target creation status by calling the
        DescribeMountTargets operation, which among other things returns the
        mount target state.

        We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability
        Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an
        Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability
        Zone. For more information, see `Amazon
        EFS <http://aws.amazon.com/efs/>`__. In addition, by always using a
        mount target local to the instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a
        partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your mount
        target is created goes down, then you can't access your file system
        through that mount target.

        system:

           replication configuration. The destination file system configuration
           consists of the following properties:

              replication is available in all Amazon Web Services Regions that
              Amazon EFS is available in, except Africa (Cape Town), Asia
              Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Europe (Milan), and
              Middle East (Bahrain).

           -  **Availability Zone** - If you want the destination file system to
              use EFS One Zone availability and durability, you must specify the
              Availability Zone to create the file system in. For more
              information about EFS storage classes, see `Amazon EFS storage
              classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/storage-classes.html>`__
              in the *Amazon EFS User Guide*.

           -  **Encryption** - All destination file systems are created with
              encryption at rest enabled. You can specify the Key Management
              Service (KMS) key that is used to encrypt the destination file
              system. If you don't specify a KMS key, your service-managed KMS
              key for Amazon EFS is used.

              After the file system is created, you cannot change the KMS key.

        The following properties are set by default:

        -  **Performance mode** - The destination file system's performance mode
           matches that of the source file system, unless the destination file
           system uses EFS One Zone storage. In that case, the General Purpose
           performance mode is used. The performance mode cannot be changed.

        -  **Throughput mode** - The destination file system uses the Bursting
           Throughput mode by default. After the file system is created, you can
           modify the throughput mode.

        The following properties are turned off by default:

        -  **Lifecycle management** - EFS lifecycle management and EFS
           Intelligent-Tiering are not enabled on the destination file system.
           After the destination file system is created, you can enable EFS
           lifecycle management and EFS Intelligent-Tiering.

        -  **Automatic backups** - Automatic daily backups not enabled on the

        applications using those mounts. To avoid applications getting cut off
        abruptly, you might consider unmounting any mounts of the mount target,
        if feasible. The operation also deletes the associated network
        interface. Uncommitted writes might be lost, but breaking a mount target
        using this operation does not corrupt the file system itself. The file
        system you created remains. You can mount an EC2 instance in your VPC by
        using another mount target.

        This operation requires permissions for the following action on the file
        system:

        -  ``elasticfilesystem:DeleteMountTarget``

        The ``DeleteMountTarget`` call returns while the mount target state is
        still ``deleting``. You can check the mount target deletion by calling
        the DescribeMountTargets operation, which returns a list of mount target
        descriptions for the given file system.

        The operation also requires permissions for the following Amazon EC2
        action on the mount target's network interface:

    ) -> LifecycleConfigurationDescription:
        """Use this action to manage EFS lifecycle management and intelligent
        tiering. A ``LifecycleConfiguration`` consists of one or more
        ``LifecyclePolicy`` objects that define the following:

        -  **EFS Lifecycle management** - When Amazon EFS automatically
           transitions files in a file system into the lower-cost Infrequent
           Access (IA) storage class.

           To enable EFS Lifecycle management, set the value of
           ``TransitionToIA`` to one of the available options.

        -  **EFS Intelligent tiering** - When Amazon EFS automatically
           transitions files from IA back into the file system's primary storage
           class (Standard or One Zone Standard.

           To enable EFS Intelligent Tiering, set the value of
           ``TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass`` to ``AFTER_1_ACCESS``.

        For more information, see `EFS Lifecycle
        Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/lifecycle-management-efs.html>`__.

        Each Amazon EFS file system supports one lifecycle configuration, which
        applies to all files in the file system. If a ``LifecycleConfiguration``
        object already exists for the specified file system, a
        ``PutLifecycleConfiguration`` call modifies the existing configuration.
        A ``PutLifecycleConfiguration`` call with an empty ``LifecyclePolicies``
        array in the request body deletes any existing
        ``LifecycleConfiguration`` and turns off lifecycle management and
        intelligent tiering for the file system.

        In the request, specify the following:

        -  The ID for the file system for which you are enabling, disabling, or
           modifying lifecycle management and intelligent tiering.

        -  A ``LifecyclePolicies`` array of ``LifecyclePolicy`` objects that
           define when files are moved into IA storage, and when they are moved
           back to Standard storage.

           Amazon EFS requires that each ``LifecyclePolicy`` object have only
           have a single transition, so the ``LifecyclePolicies`` array needs to
           be structured with separate ``LifecyclePolicy`` objects. See the
           example requests in the following section for more information.

        This operation requires permissions for the
        ``elasticfilesystem:PutLifecycleConfiguration`` operation.

        To apply a ``LifecycleConfiguration`` object to an encrypted file
        system, you need the same Key Management Service permissions as when you
        created the encrypted file system.

        :param file_system_id: The ID of the file system for which you are creating the
        ``LifecycleConfiguration`` object (String).
