        **Upserts**

        You can use the ``Version`` parameter in a ``WriteRecords`` request to
        update data points. Timestream tracks a version number with each record.
        ``Version`` defaults to ``1`` when not specified for the record in the
        request. Timestream will update an existing recordâ€™s measure value along
        with its ``Version`` upon receiving a write request with a higher
        ``Version`` number for that record. Upon receiving an update request
        where the measure value is the same as that of the existing record,
        Timestream still updates ``Version``, if it is greater than the existing
        value of ``Version``. You can update a data point as many times as
        desired, as long as the value of ``Version`` continuously increases.

        For example, suppose you write a new record without indicating
        ``Version`` in the request. Timestream will store this record, and set
        ``Version`` to ``1``. Now, suppose you try to update this record with a
        ``WriteRecords`` request of the same record with a different measure
        value but, like before, do not provide ``Version``. In this case,
        Timestream will reject this update with a ``RejectedRecordsException``
        since the updated recordâ€™s version is not greater than the existing
        value of Version. However, if you were to resend the update request with
        ``Version`` set to ``2``, Timestream would then succeed in updating the
        recordâ€™s value, and the ``Version`` would be set to ``2``. Next, suppose
        you sent a ``WriteRecords`` request with this same record and an
        identical measure value, but with ``Version`` set to ``3``. In this
        case, Timestream would only update ``Version`` to ``3``. Any further
        updates would need to send a version number greater than ``3``, or the
        update requests would receive a ``RejectedRecordsException``.
