        email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can

        an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity, and
        that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the
        identity.

        When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the
        address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link
        in the verification email.

        When you verify a domain without specifying the
        ``DkimSigningAttributes`` object, this operation provides a set of DKIM
        tokens. You can convert these tokens into CNAME records, which you then
        add to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified
        when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your
        domain. This verification method is known as `Easy
        DKIM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html>`__.

        Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing
        your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as
        Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the
        ``CreateEmailIdentity`` operation has to include the
        ``DkimSigningAttributes`` object. When you specify this object, you
        provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies
        the public key to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key.

        When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens,
        which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to
        the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when
        Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your
        domain. For some DNS providers, it can take 72 hours or more to complete
        the domain verification process.

        Additionally, you can associate an existing configuration set with the
