    checks that exist in the container image (such as those specified in a

    The Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health
    checks specified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor
    Docker health checks that are embedded in a container image and not
    specified in the container definition. Health check parameters that are
    specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks
    that exist in the container image.

    You can view the health status of both individual containers and a task
    with the DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task details in
    the console.

    The following describes the possible ``healthStatus`` values for a
    container:

    -  ``HEALTHY``-The container health check has passed successfully.

    -  ``UNHEALTHY``-The container health check has failed.

    -  ``UNKNOWN``-The container health check is being evaluated or there's
       no container health check defined.

    The following describes the possible ``healthStatus`` values for a task.
    The container health check status of nonessential containers only
    affects the health status of a task if no essential containers have
    health checks defined.

    -  ``HEALTHY``-All essential containers within the task have passed
       their health checks.

    -  ``UNHEALTHY``-One or more essential containers have failed their
       health check.

    -  ``UNKNOWN``-The essential containers within the task are still having
       their health checks evaluated or there are only nonessential
       containers with health checks defined.

    If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will
    continue its lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that
    are part of a service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task
    will be stopped and the service scheduler will replace it.

    For tasks that are a part of a service and the service uses the ``ECS``
    rolling deployment type, the deployment is paused while the new tasks
    have the ``UNKNOWN`` task health check status. For example, tasks that
    define health checks for nonessential containers when no essential
    containers have health checks will have the ``UNKNOWN`` health check
    status indefinitely which prevents the deployment from completing.

    The following are notes about container health check support:

    -  Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the
       Amazon ECS container agent. For more information, see `Updating the
       Amazon ECS container
       agent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html>`__.

    -  Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers

       Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the

    -  This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or
       greater on your container instance.

    -  For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS
       container agent must register the available logging drivers with the
       ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before
       containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration
       options. For more information, see `Amazon ECS container agent

        """Runs and maintains your desired number of tasks from a specified task
        definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the
        ``desiredCount``, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the
        specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService
        action.

        In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service,
        you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers.
        The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are
        associated with the service. For more information, see `Service load
        balancing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

        Tasks for services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy
        if they're in the ``RUNNING`` state. Tasks for services that use a load
        balancer are considered healthy if they're in the ``RUNNING`` state and
        are reported as healthy by the load balancer.

        There are two service scheduler strategies available:

        -  ``REPLICA`` - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains
           your desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the
           service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can
           use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task
           placement decisions. For more information, see `Service scheduler
           concepts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html>`__
           in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

        -  ``DAEMON`` - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task
           on each active container instance that meets all of the task
           placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service
           scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running
           tasks. It also stops tasks that don't meet the placement constraints.
           When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number
           of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling
           policies. For more information, see `Service scheduler
           concepts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html>`__
           in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

        You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service.
        The deployment is initiated by changing properties. For example, the
        deployment might be initiated by the task definition or by your desired
        count of a service. This is done with an UpdateService operation. The
        default value for a replica service for ``minimumHealthyPercent`` is
        100%. The default value for a daemon service for
        ``minimumHealthyPercent`` is 0%.

        If a service uses the ``ECS`` deployment controller, the minimum healthy
        percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service
        that must remain in the ``RUNNING`` state during a deployment.
        Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of your desired number of
        tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your
        container instances are in the ``DRAINING`` state if the service
        contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can
        deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if you
        set your service to have desired number of four tasks and a minimum
        healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to
        free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. If they're in
        the ``RUNNING`` state, tasks for services that don't use a load balancer
        are considered healthy . If they're in the ``RUNNING`` state and
        reported as healthy by the load balancer, tasks for services that *do*
        use a load balancer are considered healthy . The default value for
        minimum healthy percent is 100%.

        If a service uses the ``ECS`` deployment controller, the **maximum
        percent** parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in
        a service that are allowed in the ``RUNNING`` or ``PENDING`` state
        during a deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of
        the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer). This
        happens when any of your container instances are in the ``DRAINING``
        state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using
        this parameter, you can define the deployment batch size. For example,
        if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent
        value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping
        the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do
        this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.

        If a service uses either the ``CODE_DEPLOY`` or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment
        controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the **minimum
        healthy percent** and **maximum percent** values are used only to define
        the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that
        remain in the ``RUNNING`` state. This is while the container instances
        are in the ``DRAINING`` state. If the tasks in the service use the
        Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent
        values aren't used. This is the case even if they're currently visible
        when describing your service.

        When creating a service that uses the ``EXTERNAL`` deployment
        controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at
        the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You
        control your services using the CreateTaskSet operation. For more
        information, see `Amazon ECS deployment
        types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html>`__
        in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

        When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task
        placement. For information about task placement and task placement
        strategies, see `Amazon ECS task
        placement <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement.html>`__

        The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model. This is
        because of the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This
        means that the result of an API command you run that affects your Amazon
        ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent
        commands you run. Keep this in mind when you carry out an API command
        that immediately follows a previous API command.

        To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:

        -  Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify
           it. Run the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff
           algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous
           command to propagate through the system. To do this, run the
           DescribeTasks command repeatedly, starting with a couple of seconds
           of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait
           time.

        -  Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks
           command returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff
           algorithm starting with a couple of seconds of wait time, and
           increase gradually up to about five minutes of wait time.

        """Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance.

        Once a container instance has reached an ``ACTIVE`` state, you can
        change the status of a container instance to ``DRAINING`` to manually
        remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system
        updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.

        A container instance can't be changed to ``DRAINING`` until it has
        reached an ``ACTIVE`` status. If the instance is in any other status, an
        error will be received.

        When you set a container instance to ``DRAINING``, Amazon ECS prevents
        new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance
        and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances
        in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the
        container instance that are in the ``PENDING`` state are stopped
        immediately.

        Service tasks on the container instance that are in the ``RUNNING``
        state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment
        configuration parameters, ``minimumHealthyPercent`` and
        ``maximumPercent``. You can change the deployment configuration of your
        service using UpdateService.

        -  If ``minimumHealthyPercent`` is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore
           ``desiredCount`` temporarily during task replacement. For example,
           ``desiredCount`` is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler
           to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the
           minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks
           until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for
           services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if
           they're in the ``RUNNING`` state. Tasks for services that use a load
           balancer are considered healthy if they're in the ``RUNNING`` state
           and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.

        -  The ``maximumPercent`` parameter represents an upper limit on the
           number of running tasks during task replacement. You can use this to
           define the replacement batch size. For example, if ``desiredCount``
           is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before
           stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster
           resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%,
           then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have
           stopped.

        Any ``PENDING`` or ``RUNNING`` tasks that do not belong to a service
        aren't affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually.

        A container instance has completed draining when it has no more
        ``RUNNING`` tasks. You can verify this using ListTasks.

        When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container
        instance to ``ACTIVE`` status and once it has reached that status the
        Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

        For services using the rolling update (``ECS``) you can update the
        desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, load
        balancers, service registries, enable ECS managed tags option, propagate
        tags option, task placement constraints and strategies, and task
        definition. When you update any of these parameters, Amazon ECS starts
        new tasks with the new configuration.

        For services using the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) deployment
        controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, health
        check grace period, task placement constraints and strategies, enable
        ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags can be updated using this
        API. If the network configuration, platform version, task definition, or
        load balancer need to be updated, create a new CodeDeploy deployment.
        For more information, see
        `CreateDeployment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html>`__
        in the *CodeDeploy API Reference*.

        For services using an external deployment controller, you can update
        only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies,
        health check grace period, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate
        tags option, using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network
        configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated,
        create a new task set For more information, see CreateTaskSet.

        You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task
        definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is
        running in and a new ``desiredCount`` parameter.

        If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create
        a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The
        service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent
        parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the
        deployment strategy.

        If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the
        existing task definition for your service (for example,
        ``my_image:latest``), you don't need to create a new revision of your
        task definition. You can update the service using the
        ``forceNewDeployment`` option. The new tasks launched by the deployment
        pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they
        start.

        You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a
        deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service,
        the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters,
        ``minimumHealthyPercent`` and ``maximumPercent``, to determine the
        deployment strategy.

        -  If ``minimumHealthyPercent`` is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore
           ``desiredCount`` temporarily during a deployment. For example, if
           ``desiredCount`` is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler
           to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for
           services that don't use a load balancer are considered healthy if
           they're in the ``RUNNING`` state. Tasks for services that use a load
           balancer are considered healthy if they're in the ``RUNNING`` state
           and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.

        -  The ``maximumPercent`` parameter represents an upper limit on the
           number of running tasks during a deployment. You can use it to define
           the deployment batch size. For example, if ``desiredCount`` is four
           tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the
           four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do
           this are available).

        When UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of
        ``docker stop`` is issued to the containers running in the task. This
        results in a ``SIGTERM`` and a 30-second timeout. After this,
        ``SIGKILL`` is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the
        container handles the ``SIGTERM`` gracefully and exits within 30 seconds
        from receiving it, no ``SIGKILL`` is sent.

        When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task
        placement in your cluster with the following logic.

        -  Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can
           support your service's task definition. For example, they have the
           required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes.

        -  By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across
           Availability Zones in this manner even though you can choose a
           different placement strategy.

           -  Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running
              tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the
              instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and
              zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either
              zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.

           -  Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an
              optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring
              container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for
              this service.

        When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain
        balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the
        following logic:

        -  Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks
           for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For
           example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C
           each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are
           considered optimal for termination.

        -  Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone
           (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the
           largest number of running tasks for this service.

        You must have a service-linked role when you update any of the following
        service properties. If you specified a custom IAM role when you created
        the service, Amazon ECS automatically replaces the
        `roleARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_Service.html#ECS-Type-Service-roleArn>`__
        associated with the service with the ARN of your service-linked role.
