        archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive.
        After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to
        retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault
        inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more
        information, see InitiateJob.

        Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when

        returns an error and the operation fails.

        Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first

        which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get
        the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however,
        that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List
        Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List
        Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.

        When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in
        number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied
        by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4

        Every part you upload to this resource (see UploadMultipartPart), except
        the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size
        or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If
        you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will
        upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB.

        You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a
        multipart upload because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to
        specify the overall archive size.

        After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier)
        removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Glacier also
        removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload

        The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the

        Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the

        Using the ``statuscode`` parameter, you can specify to return only jobs

        Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following
        conditions is true:

        -  **SHA256 tree hash does not match** To ensure that part data is not
           corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part
           and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon
           S3 Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values

           SHA256 tree hash, see `Computing
           Checksums <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html>`__.

        -  **Part size does not match** The size of each part except the last
           must match the size specified in the corresponding
           InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be
           the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.

           If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you
           specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is
           not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed.
           However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.

        -  **Range does not align** The byte range value in the request does
           not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate
           request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4
           MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607
           (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value
           of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the
           upload will fail.

        This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple
        times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the
        previously uploaded data.
